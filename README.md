## Brief 
Develop a chatbot that detects user frustration or satisfaction and adjusts its responses to provide better customer service. For example, if the sentiment is negative, the chatbot could apologize and offer assistance.  If the sentiment is positive, the chatbot can thank the user for their feedback and ask if they would like to leave a review or share their experience.
